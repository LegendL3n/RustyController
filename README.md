# RustyController

A simple project to play with some LEDs :)

## Motivation

I started this project because I wanted to learn Rust, but didn't have any use for it.

However... I could play with PsMove's LED!

I've used [C++ in the past](https://github.com/LegendL3n/MembroEsquerdo) to interact with them but C++ is a pain...

## Plugins

The plugins in this [repo](https://github.com/LegendL3n/RustyController-plugins) give this project a utility. (yes, there is one, I promise! ðŸ˜…)

Those plugins are scripts that use the GraphQL API.

## Setting up

Read the [server instructions](server/README.md).

## Acknowledge

I've made use of [psmoveapi's](https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi) source, to know how to interact with the controller using HIDAPI, and its request structures.
